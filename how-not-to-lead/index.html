          When we think of great leaders, most people tend to think of figures from history - generally the
          fields of politics, or war, or sport - people like this:

        These are some of the images that first came to mind for me when I thought of people who symbolised
        leadership in different ways.

        These individuals are all flawed in their own way, and some of them are deeply problematic.

        The fact that all the people pictured here are men is also problematic, but that's not what I'm here to talk
        about.

        In this talk I want to talk about some other problems - the mistakes that we make as leaders.

        Sometimes as a technical lead, you want to do what you're good at.

        For most leads, we've been promoted after demonstrating our competence as effective individual
        contributors.


        , you get satisfaction from solving problems - building things, writing code, fixing bugs.

        As an effective individual contributor, you want to be in the thick of things, getting things done. When
        you see your team struggling, you’re tempted to jump in and do it. It’s quicker just to do it yourself.
        But it's not scalable, and it doesn't leave space for the team to learn

        It's nice for your ego to be treated like a hero.

        It's not scalable, and it's not good for your health.

        The team don't get a chance to learn.

        This is the mistake that I most frequently make.

        Good talk on this and other things by Pat Kua at Lead Dev London 2017

        Some leaders believe that information is power, and want to hoard it to maximise their power.

        If not having enough information is a problem, having too much noise coming at the team.

        Value people’s time - don’t involve them unless they need to be involved

        Meetings are expensive, even when working remotely. Perhaps even more so when working remotely

        One of the best project managers I ever worked with had the very valuable skill of shielding the team
        from noise. He protected them from clients where necessary. He did his job, trusted his team, and got
        out of their way so that they could get on with their jobs.

        Sometimes technical leads can see themselves as gatekeepers of the code, keeping quality high, reviewing every line for potential problems.
        An obsession with quality can slow down progress.  
        Sometimes we might need to remind ourselves that our clients aren't paying for elegant code, they're paying for working systems.

        On the other hand, it's not OK to just ship any old rubbish.
        
        We need to encourage our teams to care about quality.

        So you've probably noticed a theme running through these slides, and I'm definitely not the first person
        to propose it.

        It's the Goldilocks principle - not too hot or too cold, but just right.

        It's the golden mean.

        It's Buddhism's Middle Way.

        There are other axes we could think of
        It's assertive communication, as opposed to passive or aggressive

        In almost every aspect of life, and of leadership, taking an extreme path is likely to lead to problems.
