        # How We Work
        ### Building an engineering culture

          Not a technical talk, not Drupal-specific  
          No code examples,   
          But I hope it will help make your team more effective, resilient, stronger
          Based on a blog post I wrote with Andrew Harmel-Law, who leads our Java team

        ## Our Manifesto

        <ul>
          <li class="fragment">As Software Engineers we build things using technology. We build complex things, but we aim for simplicity.</li>
          <li class="fragment">We focus on the details, and on the bigger picture.</li>
          <li class="fragment">We know that software is almost never built in isolation, and we value the benefits that wide collaboration brings.</li>
          <li class="fragment">We continually adapt to the evolving and emerging requirements of our clients.</li>
        </ul>

        ## Our Manifesto
        <ul>
          <li>We care about quality, whether that means the security of the applications we build, the performance and user experience, or the things that the end user doesn't see, like coding standards and maintainability.</li>
          <li class="fragment">We believe that automation is essential to making our work reliable, efficient and repeatable, so we keep it at the heart of everything we do.</li>
          <li class="fragment">We believe that the best way of learning is by doing, and by sharing what we've learned.</li>
          <li class="fragment">We value our colleagues as human beings and as engineers, in that order.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Importance of thinking about human beings   
          "All technical problems are people problems" - https://blog.fogcreek.com/all-software-problems-are-people-problems-interview-with-roy-osherove/  
          I believe this is why we're not out of a job yet - haven't been offshored or replaced by robots  
          Describing requirements is difficult  
          Communication between humans is the most important part of our job  
          Everyone is human - we all get things wrong

          When I see what some of my colleagues work on, I feel stupid  
          I'm lucky to work on a team with some very smart, very helpful people  
          But don't be reliant on help  
          Someone said in a different context: People have had enough of experts  
          Experts, Gurus, Ninjas, Rockstars  
          Experts are just people who have thought about a problem for longer
          than you  
          [physicist Niels Bohr: "An expert is a person who has found out by his own
          painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow
          field."](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr)

        <aside class="notes">
          Teams need to communicate - internally and between teams  
          e.g. devops should be a culture, not a team  

          Knowledge shouldn't be hoarded, but shared.  
          Learn by teaching - don't understand something until you've explained it  

          Job role can evolve, roles change - examples on our team:  
          moving between Drupal / Devops / Java / Front end

          If you see a problem, tell someone.

          Don't operate a blame culture.  
          We're all on the same team, working towards the same goal.

          Don’t just fix the symptom, fix the cause  

          We're all human.

          I prefer humans to machines. Humans are great.  
          But we're not good at repetitive tasks.  
          They're boring, and our minds wander.  
          So let's get machines to do them for us.
